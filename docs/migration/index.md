## v4 to v5

### Where v4 documents go?
To keep simplicity, the document pages describes only for latest version.
Therefore you cannot read web page style documents of conventional win-vind, but you can read old documents in markdown preview style in GitHub.  
For v4.3.3, please refer to [this documents](https://github.com/pit-ray/win-vind/blob/v4.3.3/docs/cheat_sheet/index.md).
