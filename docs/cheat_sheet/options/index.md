## Parameter ID and Defaults 

|ID|Type|Default|Note|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|
|`arrangewin_ignore`|str||A list of executable filenames to ignore in ArrangeWindows. For example, if you want to remove rainmeter and gvim from the alignment, write `set arrangewin_ignore = rainmeter, gvim`. The name is the name of the executable file without extension.|
|`autofocus_textarea`|bool|false|Automatically focus on the nearest text area when switching to **Editor Normal Mode**|
|`autotrack_popup`|bool|false|It is one of standard options on Windows. For example, if shown **Are you sure you want to move this file to the Recycle Bin?**, it automatically moves the cursor to the popup window.|

|`blockstylecaret_width`|num|15|Width of block style caret on solid mode|
|`blockstylecaret`|bool|false|Block Style Caret|
|`charbreak`|str|grapheme|Mode for how to split a single Unicode character. The `grapheme` mode treats a combination character as a single character. The `codepoint` mode processes the combination character for each codepoint.|
|`charcache`|bool|false|It is a very small cache for one character used by `x` or `X` commands. If it is enabled, the clipboard is opened per once typing. Therefore, you will get the same behavior as the original Vim, whereas the performance maybe drop a litte.|
|`cmd_bgcolor`|str|323232|Background color in the virtual command line. (# is optional)|
|`cmd_fadeout`|num|5|Fade-out time in seconds for the virtual command line. If you want the command line to always be visible, make this value large enough.|
|`cmd_fontcolor`|str|c8c8c8|Font color in the virtual command line. (# is optional)|
|`cmd_fontextra`|num|1|Horizontal character spacing in virtual command line.|
|`cmd_fontname`|str|Consolas|Font name for virtual command line. If an empty string is passed, the system font will be used.|
|`cmd_fontsize`|num|23|Font size in virtual command line|
|`cmd_fontweight`|num|400|Font weight in virtual command line. Its maximum value is 1000.|
|`cmd_roughpos`|str|LowerMid|Rough position of virtual command line. The choices are `UpperLeft`, `UpperMid`, `UpperRight`, `MidLeft`, `Center`, `MidRight`, `LowerLeft`, `LowerMid`, or `LowerRight`.|
|`cmd_xmargin`|num|32|Use `cmd_roughpos` to determine the rough position, and `cmd_xmargin` to determine the detailed horizontal position. The units are in pixels.|
|`cmd_ymargin`|num|96|Use `cmd_roughpos` to determine the rough position, and `cmd_ymargin` to determine the detailed vertical position. The units are in pixels.|
|`cmd_monitor`|str|primary|The monitor on which to draw the command line. The choices are `primary`, `all`, `active`, `${NUMBER}`. The `primary` displays the command line on the primary monitor only. `all` draws command lines on all monitos. `active` displays command lines on the monitor where the selected window is located. `${NUMBER}` shows the command line on `${NUMBER}`th monitor. The `${NUMBER}` is a number starting from 0 and assigned from the left monitor. For example, `set cmd_monitor=1`.|
|`cursor_accel`|num|95|Pixel-level acceleration in the constatnt acceleration motion of the mouse cursor.|
|`cursor_resolution`|num|250|A weight for scaling the time of constant acceleration motion of the mouse cursor.|
|`dedicate_to_window`|bool|false|If **Dedicate to One window** enables, you can select one window with `enable_targeting_of_dedicate_to_window`. In this case, it makes the mode automatically switch to Editor Normal Mode on the targeting window. When the foreground window change to another, it makes the mode switch to Insert Mode. The targeting becomes disable with `disable_targeting_of_dedicate_to_window`. In other words, this feature transforms some normal editors to fake Vim. The computing cost is so small.|
|`easyclick_bgcolor`|str|323232|Font background color of hints in EasyClick|
|`easyclick_colordecay`|num|100|Matching color decay of hints in EasyClick|
|`easyclick_fontcolor`|str|c8c8c8|Font color of hints in EasyClick|
|`easyclick_fontname`|str|Arial|Font name of hints in EasyClick|
|`easyclick_fontsize`|num|14|Font size of hints in EasyClick|
|`easyclick_fontweight`|num|500|Font weight of hits in EasyClick. Its maximum value is 1000.|
|`gui_fontname`|str|Segoe UI|Font name of GUI. If an empty string is passed, the system font will be used.|
|`gui_fontsize`|num|11|Font size of GUI|
|`hscroll_pageratio`|num|0.125|The ratio of one page to the screen width to determine the amount of scrolling movement as a page.
|`hscroll_speed`|num|10|Horizontal scrolling speed of the mouse wheel.|
|`icon_style`|str|resources/icon32_dark.ico|Style of the icon to be displayed on the taskbar. By default, **Dark** and **Light** styles are available. The former is `resources/icon32_dark.ico` and the latter is `resouces/icon32_light.ico`. By the way, you can use any tasktray icon you like as long as it is in `.ico` format and **32x32**.|
|`initmode`|str|i|Initial mode of win-vind. The value is the mode prefix.|
|`jump_margin`|num|10|A margin in pixels to prevent jumping off the screen when jumping to the edge of the screen using `jump_cursor_to_left`, etc.|
|`keybrd_layout`|str||Keyboard layout kmp file referenced by `jump_cursor_with_keybrd_layout`. By default, only **US (101/102)** or **JP (106/109)** layouts are supported. If your keyboard is not the right one, please create your own kmp file and use its path as the value. If you leave the value empty, the KMP file will be selected automatically.|
|`listen_interval`|float|1.0|The time interval in seconds at which the server win-vind will retrieve command requests sent by the client with the `-c` argument.|
|`shell`|str|cmd|Name of the shell to use for `:!` commands|
|`shell_startupdir`|str||The current directory where commands (e.g. `:shell`, `:terminal`, `:!`) will be executed.

|`suppress_for_vim`|bool|false|It makes the mode of win-vind automatically switch to **Resident Mode** on the applications included the strings called **VIM** in an executable file name. Thus, it allows us to smoothly move from win-vind having the same key-bindings as Vim to Vim applications.|
|`tempdir`|str|~/Downloads|Where to download the file with the update checking.|
|`uiacachebuild`|bool|false|EasyClick and `autofocus_textarea` are slow because they scan the UI object after being called. If this option is enabled, scanning is done asynchronously and cache is used as a result. Using the cache is 30 times faster than scanning linearly, but the location information, etc. may not always be correct.|
|`uiacachebuild_lifetime`|num|1500|Cache lifetime (ms). A high value reduces the computational cost, but decreases the reliability of the cache. A low value increases the computational cost due to frequent cache creation, but guarantees reliability.|
|`uiacachebuild_staybegin`|num|500|The time between when the mouse cursor stops moving and when it starts to build a cache. In order to reduce unnecessary computational cost, it is desirable not to create a cache when there is no operation. Therefore, it should be updated only immediately after the mouse stops. The value of this option is the time(ms) that the mouse cursor is considered to be stopped. Please refer to [appendix](#overview-of-stay-range-in-uiacachebuild)|
|`uiacachebuild_stayend`|num|2000|In order to reduce unnecessary computational cost, it is desirable not to create a cache when there is no operation. The value of this option is the time(ms) between the time the cursor stops moving and the time it stops creating a cache. Please refer to appendix [appendix](#overview-of-stay-range-in-uiacachebuild)|
|`vcmdline`|bool|true|show virtual command line|
|`vscroll_pageratio`|num|0.125|The ratio of one page to the screen height to determine the amount of scrolling movement as a page.

|`window_velocity`|num|100|Pixel-level velocity in the constatnt acceleration motion of the window in winresizer.|
|`window_hdelta`|num|100|Window Width delta for resizing|
|`window_vdelta`|num|100|Window height delta for resizing|
|`winresizer_initmode`|num|0|Initial mode of window resizer ([0]: Resize, [1]: Move, [2]: Focus)|
